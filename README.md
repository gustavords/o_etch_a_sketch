Gustavo's etch-a-Sketch Porject from the Odin Project | Foundations | Javascript Basiscs

Ideas:
-make the paint function better when leaving grid (it paints everything, event listner fails once you are outside of grid)

-make it look nice

- add other functions such as colours, rainbow, and clearCanvas
